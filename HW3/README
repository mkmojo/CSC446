Homework: {Implement linear regression for the voting dataset using Python. Split the 435 examples into 348 train / 45 dev / 42 test and report your classification accuracy on the test set.}

************ Files *********
{
    hw3.py      : The source
    Makefile    : Makefile for this assignment
    voting2.dat : Data used for this assignment
    README      : This document
}

************ Algorithm *****
{
    Parse voting2.dat to get vector y and feature matrix X.
    Train the model using normal equaiton. Get modle W. 
    Verify the modle accuracy on dev set. Tune the parameter lam. 
    Test W on test set.
}

************ Instructions ***
{
    At the same place of hw2.py, please type make.
    The following result will show up:
        [[-0.17719988]
        [-0.07528204]
        [ 0.01909786]
        [-0.33751378]
        [ 0.32652356]
        [-0.1244219 ]
        [ 0.09704044]
        [ 0.05616291]
        [-0.16227952]
        [ 0.06095778]
        [-0.16754543]
        [ 0.18445769]
        [-0.00312464]
        [ 0.03583647]
        [-0.06805278]
        [-0.02754466]]
        accuracy for dev set is : 0.822222222222 with lambda: 0
        accuracy for test set is : 0.880952380952 with lambda: 0
    The first part(from line 26 to 41) is the final parameters I got for linear model W. 
    The second part(line 42) is the accuracy model W on dev set.
    The third part(line 43) is the accuracy model W on test set.

************ Results *******
{
    Please seee the above section    
}

************ Your interpretation ****
{
    The result I get can be improved, because I tried randomly selecting tranning data, and the result is slightly better than what I have right now. However the behavior will be unstable in that case. 
    Overall I belive that the data we are given right now is not enough, therefore the lamda here does not have a chance to be greater than 0. We are far away from over fitting the model.
